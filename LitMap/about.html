<p>Abiding by the supreme duty of human beings to help the denizens of darkness emerge out to the bright shimmering sun; Literacy Mission was established in the winters of 2004. The founders of the Literacy Mission were students of NIT-H : <b> Mr.Amit Sharma, Mr.Aseem Kapoor, Mr.Ashish Chaudhary</b> and some other fellowmates, who were distressed at seeing the pitiable conditions of the kids who roamed in the campus and fantasized about a life worth living. Literacy Mission started with the <b>vision of adorning the lives of kids residing in nearby slums with a bouquet of education</b> so that their childhood would remain as precious as that of the other children.<br></p>
                    
<p class="wow fadeInUp text-center"  data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay=".6s">These kids come from the <b>families labouring at construction sites</b> and most of them are immigrants from different states and some from the neighbouring countries too, foraging for livelihood. The quality of their life is so impoverish that they could not provide the basic necessities for the growth of their children. Consequently, the kids are deprived of education as well as an apt environment to nourish.</p>

<p style="text-indent:!important">Literacy Mission endeavours to facilitate the kids with the anything and everything which endows them to accomplish success in field of education in order to make them better citizens of India. Efforts are being made to bring every opportunity to raise them intellectually and enrich their lives.<br><br></p>
                    
<p>Initially, Literacy Mission faced trials and tribulations to accommodate kids and finance their needs. Moreover the volunteers backing the cause lacked the <b>emotional endorsement</b>. The volunteers could not get the rooms for teaching the kids. But soon, with the immense support of some of the faculty members Literacy Mission was able to get a place to dwell. Financial scarcity was one of the major weaknesses with the mission, but the team fostered the idea of a cultural cum charity festival <b><a href="prayas.php">&#8216;PRAYAS&#8217;</a></b>-Concert For A Cause" with the purpose of generating funds. One of the foremost challenges was to convince the parents towards their wards' education. But with the constant visit to the parents and the pursuit of Mission in the course to literate kids, made volunteers earn the faith of families and they started sending their kids to study at Literacy Mission. As per the rule of nature, though it may pose hurdles to strengthen the noble yet never inhibits the most aspirant. Henceforth Literacy Mission grew in its entire domain and outshone. <br> Literacy Mission earned its identity in 2006 when it was made an extra-curricular activity for students at NITH. Since then the Mission has attracted many students of the institute. The daily classes of Literacy Mission are held at lecture halls of NITH which enrols more than 150 kids, 40 regular volunteers and a total of 100 volunteers. Sometimes, volunteers versus kids ratio becomes 1:2, seldom found in schools. In its focus to groom kids,  Literacy Mission has been actively organising various activities like drawing and painting competitions, essay writing competition, extempore, etc. to make them recognize their talents. Movies and plays are shown, general knowledge and presentation based quiz are also organised and rewards are presented to provide them a morale boost up. Major national and Cultural festivals are celebrated with the aim of bejewelling their lives with a moment of ecstasy.<br> <br></p>
                    
<p> Literacy Mission has always tried to add its bit to the life of kids and shall continue its efforts to the good of being… Embracing the thought that <br><center><br><b>"Every child must know that he is a miracle, that since the beginning of the world there hasn't been, and until the end of the world there will not be, another child like him"</b></center></p>
